# Default card image for Facebook / Twitter Link Preview (Cards)
# would a CDN cdn.kapwing.com be better
# https://metatags.io/ to see what it looks like - metatags - not
#    open graph tags...
# debugger - https://www.linkedin.com/post-inspector/inspect/
# trying to find help: https://www.opengraph.xyz/
#   - says it works Title, Description & Image are all correct.
#   - https://www.opengraph.xyz/url/https%3A%2F%2Fgajol.github.io%2Fbalance%2F/
#   - proves good on Facebook, LinkedIn, Discord and Twitter
#   - but preview is not working on Twitter to my knowledge
#     - it works, it just takes about 30-60 seconds for the Twitter validator
#       to display the preview.
# Note: You need to validate cards are working and have Twitter approve
# Player Cards before they will begin showing up.
